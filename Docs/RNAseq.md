Fast-QC
-------

- Quality control
- Generates a http file
- Want to ensure that your reads are mostly in the green section.
- Why do? Because your read quality decreases at the end of each read.
- Here is an example of a [good quality](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/good_sequence_short_fastqc/fastqc_report.html) read, note the 'per base sequence quality' has very low variation and across the reads it has a high quality score. You should look at each of the features for a 'tick' as these vary depending on your read quality.
